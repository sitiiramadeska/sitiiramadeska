Hi, I'm Siti Ramadeska, but you can just call me Siti. I'm passionate about data analysis and statistics, and I'm using this space to share my projects and coding adventures.
I'm a recent graduate with a degree in statistics. My journey began with my love for social media and a deep curiosity about the insights hidden within the data generated by these platforms.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of my data analysis projects, ranging from exploratory data analysis to machine learning applications. 
I'm constantly learning and improving my skills, so expect to see updates and new projects regularly.


I'm always open to collaboration and feedback, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about data!
You can find me on:

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸš€
